## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge of this assignment is to refactor the code to remove redundant elements/classes and to use semantic elements to better describe the elements on the page.

### User Story

AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how semantic elements can be used to make the html more readable and cleaner because of its keywords instead of seeing div used over and over again. Alt tags must be descriptive for accessibility use and as for background images used in CSS where an alt tag cannot be used, a title can be used to describe the image in the element.
